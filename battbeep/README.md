# battbeep.sh
Beeps the PC speaker on your laptop when it's unplugged.

## But why?
This script is mainly intended for people who have laptops being used as
servers. Of course, a professional would never do this, but I'm sure at least
some hobbyists do for personal websites. Laptop batteries function as a built
in UPS of sorts, but rather than just let your laptop silently drain itself
to death during a power outage, you can have it alert you with this script,
so you can take corrective action as necessary before it happens.

## Usage
Simply run `battbeep.sh` in any terminal window It will require superuser
privileges. When it goes off, you will need to kill it manually with Ctrl-C.
