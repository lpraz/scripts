# noteinit.sh
Makes a nice template for you to start your Markdown-based notes for
class, with the date, a number ordering days for notes, and information
about the course.

## Usage
Simply type `./noteinit.sh` in a folder (where you keep your notes,
presumably) with a `.noteinit` file present. This file should contain
the course's code, name and instructor, each on a separate line.
